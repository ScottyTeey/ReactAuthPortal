# ReactAuthPortal
"ReactAuthPortal" is a dynamic web application that seamlessly combines the power of React.js and .NET Core. It offers an engaging landing page with an interactive user interface, intuitive navigation, and responsive design. The portal incorporates a secure and user-friendly login modal, enhancing user experience and data privacy. 
# Frontend
To run the application you'll need to install some frontend dependencies.

1. React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
   ```
   npm install react react-dom
   ```

2. React Router: A routing library for React applications.
   ```
   npm install react-router-dom
   ```

3. React Bootstrap: A library that provides Bootstrap components as React components.
   ```
   npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
   ```

4. Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.
   ```
   npm install axios
   ```

These dependencies should cover the main components and functionalities of your application. After installing these dependencies, you can create your React components and start building your application.

To include these dependencies in your application, you can add import statements in your code like you've done before. For example:

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import { Modal, Button, Form } from 'react-bootstrap';
import { registerUser } from './api'; // Import your API function
import './RegisterModal.css'; // Import your custom CSS if needed
```

And don't forget to import `BrowserRouter` from `react-router-dom` to wrap your application with the router:

```jsx
import { BrowserRouter as Router } from 'react-router-dom';

// Wrap your entire application with the Router component
function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      {/* Your application components */}
    </Router>
  );
}
```

Remember to adjust your imports and file paths based on your project's structure.

As for the links, here are the official documentation links for the mentioned libraries:

- React: [React Documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html)
- React Router: [React Router Documentation](https://reactrouter.com/web/guides/quick-start)
- React Bootstrap: [React Bootstrap Documentation](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction/)
- Axios: [Axios Documentation](https://axios-http.com/docs/intro)

You can refer to these documentation links for detailed information on how to use and integrate each library into your application.

# Backend
Here's how you can set up the backend dependencies for working with JSON data:

1. **.NET Core SDK:** Install the .NET Core SDK to build and run your .NET Core application.
   - Download and install from: https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download

2. **CORS Middleware:** If your React frontend is hosted on a different domain, you might need CORS middleware.
   - Install with NuGet: `dotnet add package Microsoft.AspNetCore.Cors`

3. **Newtonsoft.Json:** A popular JSON library for working with JSON data in .NET applications.
   - Install with NuGet: `dotnet add package Newtonsoft.Json`
4. **Use Swagger for testing Api**

With these dependencies, you can set up your .NET Core backend to read and write data from the JSON file. You can use `System.IO.File` or `System.Text.Json` to work with JSON data, or you can use `Newtonsoft.Json` for more advanced JSON manipulation.

Remember to configure CORS settings if your React frontend is hosted on a different domain to allow cross-origin requests. You can do this in your `Startup.cs` file using the `Cors` middleware.

Here's a simplified example of how you might read and write JSON data in your .NET Core backend:

```csharp
using Microsoft.AspNetCore.Mvc;
using Newtonsoft.Json;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.IO;

namespace ReactAuthPortal.Controllers
{
    [ApiController]
    [Route("api/[controller]")]
    public class DataController : ControllerBase
    {
        private readonly string dataFilePath = "data.json";

        [HttpGet]
        public ActionResult<IEnumerable<MyDataModel>> GetData()
        {
            string jsonData = System.IO.File.ReadAllText(dataFilePath);
            var data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<List<MyDataModel>>(jsonData);
            return Ok(data);
        }

        [HttpPost]
        public ActionResult SaveData([FromBody] List<MyDataModel> data)
        {
            string jsonData = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(data, Formatting.Indented);
            System.IO.File.WriteAllText(dataFilePath, jsonData);
            return Ok();
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, `MyDataModel` represents the structure of your JSON data. The `GetData` method reads data from the JSON file, and the `SaveData` method writes data to the JSON file.

Please adjust the code according to your specific data structure and requirements. Make sure to handle error cases, implement proper validation, and secure your endpoints as needed.
